Setting up 1.19.2 server.
"FORGE_VERSION=43.4.2"

1. Minecraft 1.19.2 server requires JAVA 17. If you don't have it you can download it here: 
   https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17
   Install it in default location: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0."

2. Open eula.txt file, read EULA and change "false" to "true" if you accept it.

3. Run start_server.bat

4. To stop the Server press CTRL+C.

5. Enjoy

Don't want to bother with all setup and manual pack updates? Rent an already configured server with automatic serverpack instal, update and easy-to-use control panel where you can configure many things.

Consider supporting through by renting the server for yourself => Code: ModernGamingWorld | Bisecthosting.com/ModernGamingWorld

V E R Y   I M P R T A N T   N O T E:

- Don't remove the following, or the server won't launch (forge-auto-install.txt, server_starter.conf, or variables.txt).
- The memory requirement has been set to 8GB, this can be changed in variables.txt by changing the -Xmx8G and -Xms8G to whatever you want.
  (Example, 12GB of RAM would be -Xmx12G -Xms12G)
